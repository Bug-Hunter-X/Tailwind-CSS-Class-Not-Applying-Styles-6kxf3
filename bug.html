I'm using Tailwind CSS and I've encountered an issue where a specific class, let's say `.bg-red-500`, isn't applying the expected styling to my element.  Other Tailwind classes seem to be working correctly. I've checked my CSS file and confirmed that `@tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` are included, and that the Tailwind directives are correctly placed within my CSS file. I've also purged the CSS and restarted my development server. The issue persists.
