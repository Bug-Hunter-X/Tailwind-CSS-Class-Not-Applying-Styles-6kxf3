# Tailwind CSS Class Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where a specific Tailwind CSS class fails to apply styles, while others work as expected. The issue persists despite standard troubleshooting steps.

## Bug Description

A particular Tailwind CSS class (`.bg-red-500` in this example) does not apply the expected background color. Other classes within the same element and across the application work correctly.  The Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) is correctly configured. Purging the CSS and restarting the development server did not resolve the issue.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
3. Run the development server (e.g., using `npm run dev` or equivalent). 
4. Observe that the element with the `.bg-red-500` class does not have the red background color applied, while other Tailwind classes work correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves identifying potential conflicts with CSS specificity.  This could arise from conflicting styles defined elsewhere, or an incorrect order of classes or styles.
